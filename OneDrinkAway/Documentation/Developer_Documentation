Documentation for Developers
Setup:
Before proceeding, make sure you have the Android SDK Installed.

If you haven't previously run an android application from Eclipse, you will need to setup an 
Android virtual device (avd), or plug an android device into your computer and run the application 
on it. The avd is quite slow, so we recommend an actual android device.

How to setup an Android virtual device: http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html?hl=sk

To use your own android device, you simply need to enable usb debugging in your settings menu, 
plug the phone into your computer and run an android application. The usb debugging option is 
hard to find on some devices, so use google if you cannot find it.

Our application requires the appcompat_v7 library, so please download the zip if you do not 
have it already.

Next, visit our download page to find the latest source code release.

Now import both projects into eclipse.

You will need to make sure eclipse knows that appcompat_v7 is a library, 
so right click on appcompat_v7 in the project explorer, then click properties > Android and 
verify that "is Library" is selected. Press ok, and right click on OneDrinkAway, 
then click properties > Android. In the Library window, you may see a Reference named ../../../.. 
with a red X next to it. If you do, select it and remove it. Then click Add, and add appcompat_v7 
as a library. Press Ok and the project should be ready to run.

Eclipse will automatically build the project for you, simply select the OneDrinkAway project 
in the Package Explorer, then select Project and enable 'Build Automatically'.

All the tests for our project can be found in src/com.onedrinkaway.test, to run a test, 
simply select it and click run as > JUnit test.

The installable version of an Android application is a .apk file. Eclipse automatically 
generates the apk for a project when it is run. The apk can be found in the bin folder 
of the project after it has been built and run. To install the program on an android device, 
simply copy the apk to it, navigate to the apk in a file explorer and select it. Android will 
install the program, and it can then be found in the device's launcher.

If you have developed additional features in the OneDrinkAway app, you are welcome to 
submit your changes to our project. First, generate a full suite of tests for the new features 
you have implemented, similarly to the tests found in the test package. Then export the project 
as a zip or tar, and send it to cse403gaia@u.washington.edu. A member of our team will 
get in contact with you regarding your work.
