<h1>Developer Documentation - OneDrinkAway 1.0 Release</h1>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>These instructions apply to the UW CSE VM, which is running Fedora 19. However, they should be very similar for other distributions of Linux, such as ubuntu.</p>

<p>First, you will need to setup the Android Development Kit. You can either set-up your existing copy of eclipse, or use the copy that is included in the ADT Bundle. It can be helpful to rename the unzipped adt folder to something shorter, such as ‘adt’.</p>

<p><a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html?hl=sk#download">Set-up and instructions for the ADT Bundle can be found here.</a></p>

<p>Once you have the Android development kit setup, start eclipse and import both v7-appcompat, as well as the latest release of OneDrinkAway.</p>

<p>Both projects are available on our <a href="http://www.onedrinkaway.ava4.net/downloadPage.php">download page</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://help.eclipse.org/juno/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.user%2Ftasks%2Ftasks-importproject.htm">Instructions for importing a project can be found here.</a></p>

<p>Once you have both project imported into eclipse, you need to tell eclipse that v7-appcompat is a library. In the Package Explorer in eclipse, right click on v7-appcompat, then select Properties. In upper left corner of the pop-up window, Select Android. Verify that the ‘is Library’ box is checked, and select OK. Here is a helpful screenshot:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.onedrinkaway.ava4.net/img/isLibrary.png"></p>

<p>Next you will need to go to the same menu for OneDrinkAway. Right click on OneDrinkAway in the Project Explorer, select Properties, and select Android in the pop-up. Here you will need to remove the Reference that has a big red X by it. Select it and press Remove. Now select Add and double click on v7-appcompat. Press OK and you’re done. Here are some helpful screenshots:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.onedrinkaway.ava4.net/img/removeX.png"></p>

<p><img src="http://www.onedrinkaway.ava4.net/img/addLibrary.png"></p>

<p>If you are using a 64-bit Linux distribution (such as the CSE VM) You may need to install a few libraries. On The CSE VM, this can be done with: sudo yum install zlib.i686 libstdc++.i686</p>

<p>Our app communicates with a server, and some of the data is encoded in the gson format. You will need to add gson to the build path of the project. First go to our <a href="downloadPage.php">download page</a> to download and extract the gson.jar file. Next return to eclipse, and right click on OneDrinkAway in the project explorer. Select preferences and return to to the Libraries Tab of Java Build Path. Now select "Add External JARs…" and add the gson .jar file. FInally, click on the Order and Export Tab and select the gson library. This ensures that the library is exported with the project.</p>

<p>Your library tab should look similar to this:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.onedrinkaway.ava4.net/img/Libraries.png"></p>

<p>You Order & Export tab should look similar to this:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.onedrinkaway.ava4.net/img/OrderExport.png"></p>

<p>Note that the Jama package is used for testing code coverage and is not required to build the project</p>

<p>At this point you should be ready to build OneDrinkAway. Congratulations!</p>

<h2>Building</h2>

<p>OneDrinkAway can be built from eclipse, or from the command line with ant. By default, eclipse has build automatically selected. To generate the .apk file (which will install the app on an android device) setup an emulator, then select OneDrinkAway and press run in eclipse. This will generate OneDrinkAway.apk, which can be found in the bin folder of the project. This file can be side-loaded onto an Android device. To side-load, simply copy the .apk file to an android device, select the file and it will run the installer.</p>

<p>OneDrinkAway can also be built and run from the terminal. It is slightly more involved, but it must be done to set-up daily builds.</p>

<p>First, your machine must have ant installed. This is already included on the UW CSE VM, but can be installed via sudo apt-get install ant or sudo yum install ant from most Linux distributions.</p>

<p>Now navigate to your OneDrinkAway project folder</p>

<p>run the following command, replacing the {...} with the correct information for your system.:</p>

<p>./build.sh {path to your android build-tools folder} {path to your appcompat_v7 project}</p>

<p>This should output OneDrinkAway-debug.apk in the bin folder.</p>

<h2>Bug Tracker</h2>

<p>Our bug tracker can <a href="https://github.com/teamGaia/OneDrinkAway/issues">found here</a>. The listings under the open tab are the list of outstanding bugs and the listings under the closed tab are the resolved bugs. In order to resolve a bug, you check the checkbox corresponding to the particular bug and hit the close button on the top toolbar.</p>

<h2>Daily Builds</h2>

<p>Here are instructions for setting up daily builds.</p>

<p><a href="http://mirrors.jenkins-ci.org/war/latest/jenkins.war">Download Jenkins here.</a></p>

<p>Navigate to the directory that you downloaded in into and run the following command:</p>

<p>java -jar jenkins.war</p>

<p>Once Jenkins is up and running, open an Internet browser and go to </p>

<p>http://localhost:8080</p>

<p>Click on "New Item" and enter in a sensible name and select the "Build a free-style software project" then hit ok.</p>

<p>Scroll down until you reach the build section and select "Execute Shell" from the "Add a build step" dropdown menu.</p>

<p>Paste the following lines into the command text box, replacing the {..} with the correct information for your system:</p>

<p>cd <Path to your local OneDrinkAway project></p>

<p>./build.sh {path to your android build-tools folder} {path to your appcompat_v7 project}</p>

<p>(In future releases most of this will be handled by a script but for now this is the process)</p>

<p>To schedule daily builds, check the "Build Periodically" box and then paste</p>

<p>H H 1-31 * * </p>

<p>in the "Schedule" text box</p>

<p>All that is left to do is click save and click on "Build Now" which will compile everything and run tests. The build status will be displayed on the left hand side of the page and detailed information about each build can be examined by clicking on the date next to the build number.</p>

<p>Our build setup differs from the above step only in that we have email notification in case of a failed build. To set up email notification, you will need to go to "Configure Project" then under "Post Build Actions," "Add post-build action" then select "E-mail Notification". Add the desired email recipients then navigate back to the Jenkins Dashboard. Once there go to "Manage Jenkins" -> "Configure System" then scroll down to "E-Mail Notification" and hit advanced. Fill out all the fields with the appropriate information. We use the gmail SMTP server with SMTP authentication, SSL and port 465 as our SMTP port.</p>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>We have two test suites, one that runs regular java JUnit tests, and another that runs Android JUnit tests.</p>

<p>Our java test suite is located is located in it’s own repository, which can be <a href="https://github.com/teamGaia/JavaUnitTests">found here.</a></p>

<p>Our Android test suite is located is located in it’s own repository, which can be <a href="https://github.com/teamGaia/OneDrinkAwayAndroidUnitTests">found here.</a></p>

<p>To run both our test suites, download the project as a zip, and import it into eclipse. Next, right click on the project, and select Properties. Select Java Build Path and click on the Projects tab. Click Add… and select OneDrinkAway. This will allow you imports from the OneDrinkAway project.</p>

<p>To run our Java test suite, simply select a package in the UnitTests project and select run as>JUnit test.</p>

<p>To run our Android test suite, simply select a package in the UnitTests project and select run as>Android JUnit test.</p>

<p>Currently our code coverage for our tests is as follows (broken down by packages):</p>

<p>OneDrinkAway.app: 90.00%</p>

<p>OneDrinkAway.model:89.9%</p>

<p>OneDrinkAway.model.machinelearning:100%</p>

<p>OneDrinkAway.db: 95.6%</p>

<p>These numbers are obtained by using the EclEmma plugin for Eclispe with the UnitTests project. Unfortunately, this tool only supports jUnit tests, which can’t run Android JUnit tests which is why the OneDrinkAway.app coverage is 0.0%. Our AndroidUnitTest project contains a few Android Junit tests that test some of the UI classes in but due to time constraints these tests are not nearly as comprehensive as we would like. For the release candidate, we plan on having much more of the UI and functionality of our app covered by tests. We also plan on finding a code coverage tool that supports Android Junit tests.This will give  a much better idea of what areas we need to cover better with tests.</p>

<h2>Drink Utility</h2>

<p>We have a utility project, which contains various programs we have implemented for collecting data, updating our website and other data collection and organization tasks. You can check it out <a href="https://github.com/jlw4/DrinkUtility">here</a></p>

<h2>Server</h2>

<p>We have a web server that works as a proxy between our database and our app. The tomcat web server is running on an EC2 instance on AWS. You can ssh into the ec2 instance with:</p>

<p>sudo ssh -i /path/to/keypair.pem ec2-user@54.200.252.24</p>

<p>To start, stop or restart the tomcat server, run:</p>

<p>sudo service tomcat7 ( start | stop | restart )</p>

<p>The repository for our web server can be <a href="https://github.com/teamGaia/OneDrinkAwayServer">found here</a></p>

<h2>Updating Server</h2>

<p>To update the DrinkDbServer app, first export your modified DrinkDbServer project as DrinkDbServer.war. Next go to /usr/share/tomcat7/webapps and replace DrinkDbServer.war with your updated version. This could be done by copying your new DrinkDbServer.war to the home folder of ec2-user, and then running the command:</p>

<p>sudo cp ~/DrinkDbServer.war DrinkDbServer.war</p>

<p>Now stop the tomcat server by running:</p>

<p>sudo service tomcat7 stop</p>

<p>Now delete the DrinkDbServer folder:</p>

<p>sudo rm -df DrinkDbServer/</p>

<p>If you added a service, you need to update the web.xml file in /usr/share/tomcat7/conf. Scroll down until you see a servlet tag, and add one for your new service</p>

<p>Start the server again and you should be good to go:</p>

<p>sudo service tomcat7 start</p>

<h2>Database</h2>

<p>Our database is an RDS (Relational Database Service) running on AWS (Amazon Web Services). Examples of how to connect to the database can be seen in our DrinkDbServer repository, in class DbConnection.</p>

<h2>Updating the Database</h2>

<p>We have a tool named UpdateDrinks located in our DrinkUtility project, which automates modifying data in our database. It is important to note that using this tool drops all categories, drinks and ingredients from the database. Only run this when you are certain that the data in the files is correct. All our drink info is located in the tab separated spreadsheet "drinks.tsv" and our Recipes are located in "Recipes.txt". Both of these can found in the DrinkUtility Project. Modify the files, as then run UpdateDrinks. If some drinks are missing recipes, it will print those names to standard out and halt. If all drinks have recipes, it will go ahead and update the ingredient, category and drink tables in the database.</p>

<h2>Updating DrinkData Startup Image</h2>

<p>When the app starts, it loads a serialized image of DrinkData from the assets folder in OneDrinkAway. The app then attempts to update DrinkData from database info. If you want to update the serialized startup image, run the SaveDrinkData program in DrinkUtility. Then copy drinkdata.ser from DrinkUtility to the assets folder of OneDrinkAway.</p>

<h2>Adding and Updating Drink Images Within the App</h2>

<p>1) Change the image field of the drink in the database to the exact name that you will name your new image file, but leave off the “.png” appendage. Be sure to not include capital letters, Android is picky about those. For naming conventions we are using: underscores_between_words. For generic drink images, they should be glassname_color, such as rocks_brown or martini_clear.</p>

<p>2) The final image you submit must be in .png format. Make sure the background of the drink image is transparent, none of the drink images have backgrounds. </p>

<p>3) You will need 4 different sizes of the same image, and they must all have the same name. We are using the Android launcher icon proportions. This is so that the app can support different screen resolutions. You will need:
<ul>
    <li>A) 146px x 146px</li>
    <li>B) 96px x 96px </li>
    <li>C) 72px x 72px </li>
    <li>D) 48px x 48px </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>4) Go into OneDrinkAway/res and there are four different folders corresponding to the different sizes:
<ul>
    <li>A) drawable-xxhdpi (extra-extra high 146px x 146px)</li>
    <li>B) drawable-xhdpi (extra-high 96px x 96px)</li>
    <li>C) drawable-hdpi (high 72px x 72px) </li>
    <li>D) drawable-mdpi (medium 48px x 48px) </li>
</ul>
Put each image from step three into its corresponding folder.
Do not put any pictures in the drawable folder, that is just for .xml files </p>

<p>5) Run the app and check that your changes have been made. If there is a generic glass picture for the drink image that you have updated, then something has gone wrong somewhere, check your file naming and image name.</p>


<h2>Code Coverage Tool</h2>

<p>We are using a code coverage tool called EclEmma. To download it in Eclipse, follow these instructions <a href="http://www.eclemma.org/installation.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Branching</h2>

<p>Creating a new branch is fairly easy. First, navigate to the OneDrinkAway project folder, and run:</p>

<p>git checkout -b <branch name></p>

<p>Replacing <branch name> with the branch name you want to create. If you are a collaborator on the OneDrinkAway project, you can push your branch to github with:</p>

<p>git push origin <branch name></p>

<h2>Merging</h2>

<p>To merge your branch with master, first you need to switch back to master:</p>

<p>git checkout master</p>

<p>Then merge the two:</p>

<p>git merge <branch name></p>

<h2>Creating a New Release</h2>

<p>To create a new release, use the <a href="https://github.com/teamGaia/OneDrinkAway/releases/new">github release tool.</a> Fill out the fields and click create. This will allow you to download a .zip file containing the source code for your new release. Next, build the project with eclipse or ant, as detailed above.</p>

<p>Last, rename your .apk to onedrinkaway<release name>.apk, and rename your .zip to <release name>release.zip, to keep them consistent with our previous releases.</p>

<p>All of our releases have release-specific user and developer documentation. To create updated documents for your new release, simply download the user and developer docs for the release you started with, and edit them to reflect the changes you have made.</p>

<p>It is also a good idea to make a parallel release of DrinkUtility, DrinkDbServer and both test repos. Go to each repo and make a release with the same name as your OneDrinkAway release</p>

<h2>Uploading to Our Website</h2>

<p>Our website is hosted by dreamhost, and can be found at <a href="http://www.onedrinkaway.ava4.net">www.onedrinkaway.ava4.net</a>. To publish a new release, it needs to be added to the Download page, and updated documentation should be added to the Release page. Using FileZilla or another file transfer program, connect to the dreamhost server. You will need to <a href="http://www.onedrinkaway.ava4.net/contact.php">contact us</a> to gain the proper credentials.</p>

<p>First, upload your .zip and .apk files to the dl folder. Next, download downloadPage.php, and add a link to each file under Releases: and Source Code:. Releases are kept in descending order, so put yours at the top. Now upload your edited downloadPage.php, replacing the existing copy. Next, download releasePage.php. Now add a new heading at the top "Your Release Name", and put two paragraph tags under it, the first linking to your updated user documentation, the second linking to your updated developer documentation.</p>

<p>Finally, ensure all of your changes work! We recommend starting with a clean copy of the UW CSE VM, and follow all of your developer setup instructions start to finish, ensuring you encounter no new errors along the way. Verify that your files download and import properly, and that everything displays correctly on the website.</p>

<h2>Design Patterns</h2>

<p>Singleton: DrinkData is our primary data structure. It stores every Drink and all it’s relevant info. We want our app to run quickly with minimal lag, so keeping local memory usage down is important. DrinkData ensures that there is only once instance of each Drink and DrinkInfo for each drink in our database, and maintains only one instance of itself. We accomplish this through a private constructor, with a few public accessor fields that only return a pointer the single private instance.</p>

<p>Adapter: DrinkDb is an adapter between DrinkData and DrinkModel. It primarily functions as a collection of static classes, maintaining a static pointer to the singleton DrinkData, and passing data from DrinkData to DrinkModel. It will also send updates to the database, updating local and remote storage simultaneously.</p>
