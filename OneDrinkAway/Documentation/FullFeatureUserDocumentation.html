<h3>Product Description</h3>
	<p>OneDrinkAway is an Android application that suggests cocktails to try based on your taste preferences. It is useful for anyone who enjoys cocktails and would like to try something new. Since the application is mobile, users can get drink suggestions anywhere, whether they are at a bar or in the kitchen.</p>

	<p>There exist applications for smart phones that allow you to search for recipes or find a drink recipe at random, but none of them keep a list of your favorite drinks and provide better drink suggestions the more you use the application. We also have a rating system so that the more drinks you rate, the better the application gets to know you and can suggest drinks more geared toward your tastes. You do not have to waste your precious time searching through drink recipes and guessing whether or not you think you might like them; OneDrinkAway figures it out for you. Since your mood can change daily and you might be craving a different kind of cocktail some nights, our application also has a feature that allows you to enter what flavors you are looking for in a drink, and then recommends cocktails based on those.</p>

<h3>UI Concept</h3>
<p>The homepage of the application is based around a grid-layout in order to ease the navigation through the features for you. There are different modes in which to search for drinks, and the results of the search are a list of drinks that link to the recipes for each individual drink. From the home page, you can navigate to any feature, any of the individual searches, your favorite’s list, or the help menu. From any individual feature or page, you can always go back to the last page you were on, your search constraints will be saved if you go backwards from your search results in order to easily change your search. Also, from each individual page, you can navigate to the homescreen through the icon on the top toolbar. </p>

<h3>Opening the Application</h3>
<p>Upon opening the application, there is no need to log in because the application already knows who you are and has all of your information saved. If you are a new user, then you can start rating drinks and the application will remember you. If you close completely out of the application, all of your activity, such as the drinks that you have rated and the drinks that you have added to your favorite’s list will be saved for next time.</p>

<p>Upon first opening the application, a pop up will appear that will ask you if you would like to rate drinks to get started. If you want to know why you should rate drinks, press the "Why?" button and a dialog explaining our reasoning will appear. You can then select "No Thanks" if you do not want to rate drinks or "Rate Drinks!" if you want to rate some drinks. If you choose to rate drinks, you may rate common drinks that we think you may have tried or you may browse all drinks. To switch between these two views, click on the tabs on the top of the screen. To rate a drink, click your desired star rating below the drink name in the list and your drink rating will be saved. Once you are finished rating drinks, click finished and you will be brought to the home screen of the application.</p>

<p>The home page will appear displaying an icon for each of our features. On the top navigation bar is the name of the page you are currently on, a home icon, and a help icon. The home icon can be selected from any screen in the application which will bring the user back to this home page. The help icon (question mark) can be selected from any screen in the application to get more information about the screen you are currently viewing.</p>

<h3>Search By Name</h3>
<p>To find a certain drink, select the "Search By Name" icon. The "Search by Name" page will appear. If you need help using this feature, select the help icon on the top navigation bar. At the top is a search bar where you can type in the name of the drink you are looking for with a list of all of our drinks in alphabetical order. The search will filter the list of drinks as you type. Select a drink to view its Drink Info Page. The Drink Info Page is described below in the "Drink Info Page" section.

<h3>Search By Ingredients</h3>
<p>To find a drink that contains certain ingredients, select the "Search by Ingredients" icon. This will then bring you to the "Search by Ingredients" page. To include an ingredient in your search, select the checkbox next to it. If you do not want to scroll through the entire list of ingredients, then you may type an ingredient into the search bar at the top of the page. As you type, the ingredients list will be filtered to show only the ingredients that start with the letters that you have typed in the text box. To see all the ingredients again, simply delete all of the letters you have typed from the textbox, and all of the ingredients that you have checked will remain. Once you have checked all of the ingredients that you want to have in your drink results, press the search button. This will lead you to the results page which will list only the drinks that contain the ingredients you checked in your search. These drinks will be listed from top to bottom based on what what we think you will like the most to what we think you will like the least. The results page has the same formatting as described below in the "Results Page" section. If you would like to change your search, you may go back from the result page at anytime. The ingredients you have checked will be saved for you to make changes, or you can clear all of your checked ingredients and start again. If no results are found  a "No Results Found" message  is displayed on the top of this page so that you can easily change your search query. Search by ingredients may or may not display the correct search results at this time, we are working on it!</p>

<h3>Search By Flavors</h3>
<p>This feature displays seek bars which are movable and allow you to search for drinks based on your flavor preferences. If you leave a flavor seek bar at zero, it is not included in your search, for example if you leave all seek bars at zero, your will be given a list of all drinks as a result. 1 is the weakest setting for a flavor search and 5 is the strongest. Once you have set each seek bar to the desired setting, press the search button, and you will be taken to the results page. If there are no results found for your search query, a "No Results Found" message is displayed at the top of this page, so that you may easily change your search.</p>

<h3>Favorites Drinks</h3>

By pressing the edit button, you may remove items from your favorite drink list. Select the check box of each drink you would like to remove and press delete. You can always readd each drink late if you wish by going to its drink info page.
